    <h3 id="java-what">Java What?</h3>

<p>In today’s world of complicated user interactive websites, it is important for web developers to know and understand JavaScript. You might not realize it but most, if not all, of your favorite websites incorporate JavaScript into their web development to create “dynamic” web pages. Below are some advantages and disadvantages of using JavaScript in Web Development.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of JavaScript is that it runs on the users computer and uses the computers processor. Entire web based applications can be run right from the browser. It makes it much easier since there is nothing on the server side to configure. This leaves the busy server free to handle other jobs. JS is also be used for data entry validation to check things like valid credit card numbers. It can manipulate cookies to store user information on the browser. These are just some of the many advantages of using JavaScript.</p>

<p>But JavaScript is not without its disadvantages either. The biggest issue with JS is security. Since JS runs on the client side it can be used to inject malicious code into the users computer spreading malware and viruses. Another problem is that different browsers render JavaSrcipt differently resulting in inconsistencies across browsers. Overall the advantages of making dynamic JavaScript websites seem to outweigh the disadvantages.</p>

<p>Understanding how to move the elements into the correct position is by far one of the most important concepts of building a web page. Without this understanding it is possible to build a very simple web site but impossible to build a great website.</p>

<p>Let’s first take a look at the CSS “Box Model.” Each HTML element is essentially a container or “Box”. Looking at the representation of the HTML box below you can see that it consists of three parts: margin, border, and padding. The size of each of the three different layers can be changed by specifying the “em, %, or px” for each property. Each property in turn has multiple ways to specify its sizes. Read here for more information on the properties and values:    <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_margin.asp" target="_blank" title="Margin">Margin</a>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp" target="_blank" title="border">Border</a>  <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp" target="_blank" title="Padding">Padding</a></p>

<p><img src="/images/week_2/margin.png" alt="Box" /></p>
<figcaption><a href="http://www.washington.edu/accesscomputing/webd2/student/unit3/module4/lesson1.html" target="_blank" title="Source">Source</a></figcaption>

<p>Here is a very basic example of how to create a simple box containing content using the “Box Model” concepts.</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="css"><span class="nf">#box</span> <span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">red</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">border</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1px</span> <span class="k">solid</span> <span class="nb">black</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nf">#box</span> <span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">{</span>
	<span class="k">text-align</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">center</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">background-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nb">white</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">padding</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">1em</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="n">borer</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="k">width</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">border-style</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="k">solid</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">border-color</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">darkgrey</span><span class="p">;</span>
	<span class="k">margin</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="m">10px</span> <span class="cp">!important</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>So as you can see understanding the “box” concepts are instrumental in understanding how to move your elements around the page using CSS. This is fundamental part of HTML/CSS that needs to be mastered in order to create awesome looking, functional website.</p>

    <h3 id="what-is-pair-programming">What Is Pair Programming?</h3>

<p><img src="/images/week_5/ruby_cat.jpg" alt="Ruby" /></p>

<p>I’m going to admit it…I’m a loner. Well when it comes to completing tasks anyway. I would usually rather struggle through something on my own then admit that I don’t know what I’m doing or asking for help out of a fear of looking stupid. As I’m writing this I’m thinking to myself, “Why am I like this? This sounds like a silly way to go about a task!” But alas, this is just the nature of some people I suppose. With that said let’s discuss this new, and for some controversial, idea of pair programming.</p>

<p>So what exactly is pair programming? Pair programming is an “Agile Software Development” technique. The idea is basically to have two different coders writing code at the same machine. The pair consists of the “driver” and the “navigator,” who write code on the same computer. The driver is in charge of typing the code while the navigator watches for any mistakes and thinks about different ways to implement the code as well as the overall structure of the code. Using this technique leaves the driver able to focus on the technical side of creating code while the navigator is free to think about the overall code of the project as well as check for any mistakes in the code made by the driver. Some studies have shown that using this technique can increase productivity and decrease errors in the code. </p>

<p><img src="/images/week_5/good_coders.jpg" alt="Coders" />						</p>

<p>Those of us in Phase 0 should be getting used to using this technique by now. I have to admit the first few weeks my stomach was in knots before a paring session. It’s a bad feeling when you are new to coding and your pair seems to know exactly where to go with the code while you are still trying to figure out exactly what the instructions for the project even mean! This week for the first time I’ve come to terms with the fact that I need to pair and I need to pair often. Even though I still get nervous and sometimes feel inferior when I’m working with a more experienced boot, I learn. This week really for the first time I’ve let my fears fall away and learned to enjoy the complexities of the challenges instead of fearing them. “What is this Greek I’m looking at in front of me?!” Take a deep breath, step back and figure it out. If you cant figure it out on your own it’s ok to admit you need help. Your life will not crumble before your eyes if you do so. And most importantly pair and pair often!</p>

<p>So after the pair there’s this “feedback” thing you also have to complete. At first I thought this was a nuisance. It still seems sort of tedious at times especially when it’s 11:49 PM on Sunday night and you haven’t submitted yet! This week though I am starting to see the value in this as well. I’ve gotten a few good critical feedback suggestions that have really helped me understand a big flaw in my coding process that I am now trying to remedy and it has helped me tremendously. Yesterday for the first time a boot asked me to do feedback right then an there in person. At first I thought this was strange and was a little caught off guard. After we finished the feedback I thought it was kind of nice to listen to the persons feedback instead of reading it later. The boot actually gave me one of the most beneficial pieces of constructive criticism yet and made me realize I need to work on that to become a better coder. So I guess the moral of this story is to trust the DBC process. It may seem a bit strange and even scary or chaotic at times, but there does seem to be a method to their madness. So I leave you with this bit of advice from a n00b with just a few months of coding experience under his belt. Pair. Pair often. Pair as much as you can and listen to your feedback and try to make changes that will help you once you get to the big show on Aug 25th at DBC. Trust the process!</p>

    <h3 id="which-mindset-are-you">Which Mindset Are You?</h3>

<p>The Gregoric Thinking Style groups a person’s “thinking style” into 4 general groups. Concrete, Abstract, Sequential, and Random. I think I would fit solidly into the Concrete Sequential. A person with Concrete Sequential thinking prefers order, stability, directions, not working in groups, a structured learning environment, etc. Pretty much the exact opposite of DBC! To a CS thinker Phase 0 of DBC seems like a Abstract Random free for all!</p>

<p>For a person like me DBC is going to be a challenge. I like structure. I like order. Not having instructions makes me panic. Phase 0 has been a whirl wind of emotions and pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. This is exactly why I chose DBC over the coding schools. I want to be pushed. If they let me I will sit int he back of the class never saying a word and working by myself. I want to learn to be the person who steps up to a challenge without being forced. I want to get over my fear of public speaking and be able to express my ideas to a large group of strangers without feeling like I’m going to throw up.</p>

<figcaption>Fixed Mindset vs Growth Mindset</figcaption>
<p><img src="/images/week_3/mind.jpg" alt="Thinking" /></p>

<p>And as a double whammy I have a lot of the “Fixed Mindset” characteristics of the “Fixed vs Growth Mindset” theory. I tend to avoid challenges out of fear of failure and have a somewhat deterministic view of the world. I’m trying to become more of a Growth Mindset personality. I’ve stepped outside my comfort zone just about everyday since I’ve started Phase 0 and its getting easier day by day. I’ve found that my structured way of learning and completing my challenges doesn’t cut it in DBC. Next week I’m starting a while new way of doing things to try and management my time better.I’ve realized in the world of coding you cant spend 4 hours trying to move an element around in CSS when you have several other tasks to complete. It doesn’t matter if its perfect or not you just have to move on. This is very hard for me to accept. If I let myself I will spend all freaking day trying to move an element to the opposite side of my webpage. Time management and limiting my expectations to match my abilities are the two biggest things I will work on going forward in DBC. I’m willing to change are you?</p>

    <h3 id="the-invisible-cost-of-the-gadgets-we-love">The Invisible Cost Of The Gadgets We Love</h3>

<p>Most of us today love our gadgets. They have become part of us in many ways. We’ve all had those moments of reaching in our pockets and realizing our phone is missing…then the panic sets in. These tiny pocket size computers are filled with some of our most precious information and tools we use to navigate through life on a daily basis. Most of us never realize the true cost of these machines as we unwrap the shiny packages and dance around on Christmas Day when we receive the latest greatest version of a device we desire. There is a human cost that is never factored into the price of tech industry’s most coveted devices.</p>

<p>Now I feel I must give full disclosure as I am about to journey down the path of bashing a company of which I own several of their devices. I am an Apple fan and have been for many years. I own thousands of dollars worth of their equipment and have no intention to stop buying them in the near future. In the context of this article I am choosing to pick on apple not because they are the only or even the worst Tech industry human rights violators, but because they have become a symbol of wealth, power, and corporate dominance over mankind.</p>

<figcaption>Apple Production Facility - China</figcaption>
<p><img src="/images/week_4/workers.jpg" alt="Thinking" /></p>

<p>In some of Apple’s Chinese factories workers are asked to stand for upwards of 12 hours a day with only two 30 minute breaks in between. Some of these factories are open six days a week. now Apple claims they have a self imposed 60 hour a week limit for workers, but some Chinese human rights organizations have reported 70 hour work weeks in different plants. China Labor Watch claims that most factory workers are subjected to harsh chemicals, noise, and lasers on a daily basis without adequate protection provided by the company. There have been several reports of workers dying from exposure to chemicals or even committing suicide because of the harsh working and living conditions near the plants.</p>

<p>Now in some aspects Apple should be commended for recently taking some steps to remedy the working conditions in their overseas factories. Apple is the first and only technology company to be admitted to the Fair Labor Association because of these steps they have taken. But their is much more work that needs to be done. Heavy regulations must be enforced by the cooperation of the U.S. and Chinese governments. Corporations usually exclaim that if we regulate these things the prices of their products will increase which in turn will hurt them and their consumers. This may be true in some aspects but the markup on some of these tech products is outrageous and I would argue there is a happy medium where a giant tech corporation worth upwards of $600 Billion dollars can afford to shave off some profits to protect the people who literally create those profits. It is important to understand that all tech companies not just Apple share in this burden. I hope that in the future as the IT industry grows, it can learn to balance profits with the welfare of its workers.</p>
