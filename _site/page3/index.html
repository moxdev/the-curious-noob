  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Is Dev Bootcamp the right fit for you? The question we’ve all no doubt been asking ourselves for the past few months. Watching Shereef’s ‘Fireside Chat’ conjured feelings of sheer excitement, pure terror, a metaphorical rebirth, uncertainty, and a slew of other emotions all at once! For a year I’ve tied my gut up in knots over and over again trying to decide if DBC was worth quiting my cushy job, tearing my self away from my family, and uprooting myself to the other end of the country all for nothing more than the promise of a chance. There’s something both simultaneously empowering and terrifying about having your fate in your on hands. It’s right there in front of you all you have to do is reach out and take it.</p>

<p>I am Shereef’s friend that he spoke about in the video. A junior system administrator that always wanted to be a coder but was told not to bother unless I get a 4 year Computer Science degree from a university. The moment I read the first article about DBC I knew there was something special happening in San Francisco that I needed to be a part of. The prospect of creating something special with code and being a part of something as special as DBC is no doubt going to be one of, if not the most fantastic experience of my life. I think learning by doing is the easiest way to learn a new skill. DBC’s method of pairing us into groups and forcing all of us to take charge at certain points, instead of sitting at the back of class not saying anything, will only make us better, stronger coders when we get into the workforce. For me giving up is not an option because wearing a suit and tie to a cubicle for the next 30-40 years is not an option!</p>

<p>The wonderful life I’m leaving behind to become a coder…and yes this is every IT department you’ve ever called!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <h3 id="ruby-array-and-hash-structure">Ruby Array and Hash Structure</h3>

<p>I selfishly chose the topic of Hash’s and Array’s in the hopes that after creating this blog you and I would both be more educated on the subject so lets begin! </p>

<p>Both arrays and hashes are a rather simple way for Ruby to store a list of items called “elements.” The list of elements contained in each format can be comprised of many different types of things, or as we say in Ruby “objects.” Each method however handles its elements in a different fashion.</p>

<h3 id="the-ruby-array">The Ruby Array</h3>

<p>Arrays are structured using the bracket symbol [ ]. Inside the bracket you can have a different mix of of different types of elements. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="o">]</span>
<span class="ow">or</span>
<span class="n">array</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="o">[</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;hello&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">x</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">y</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">z</span><span class="o">]</span></code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see an array can hold several different types of elements within the same array. There are several methods built into Ruby that allow you access to the elements of your array. You can count your elements, count the entire length of the array, see which element is at which point in the array and so on. The array holds each element in a certain position starting at 0 and counting up until it reaches the last element. For example the array [1,2,3,4] would count the position of its elements at 0,1,2,3. This position is called the elements “index.” Notice how the index starts at 0 instead of 1 so the index list will always be 1 less than the total number of elements. It is important to remember that since an array holds these elements in a certain position, the elements are kept in order and can only be accessed in this particular order.</p>

<h3 id="the-ruby-hash">The Ruby Hash</h3>

<p>A hash stores elements in a slightly different way using what is called key-value pairs inside curly brackets { }. In the image above you can see the variable “inst_section” holds a group of key-value pairs. The left side objects following the colon are the keys and the right side are the values assigned to each key. You can tell the value by looking for the =&gt; symbol. The value will alway follow this symbol. The keys do not have to be prefaced with a colon. They could just as easily be strings. For example:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="ruby"><span class="n">grades</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span> 
	<span class="s2">&quot;Bob&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">82</span><span class="p">,</span> 
	<span class="s2">&quot;Jim&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">94</span><span class="p">,</span> 
	<span class="s2">&quot;Shelly&quot;</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="mi">89</span> <span class="p">}</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Now much like the arrays you can access each element either by using the key or the value. It is important to remember however that hashes do not store the elements in any particular order so if you want an ordered list you must use an array. But if you don’t care about order and you just want to store a key pair value use a hash.</p>

<p>This is just the tip of the iceberg of what arrays and hashes can be used for. In fact Ruby uses arrays and hashes for just about everything! So if you just need a simple list of ordered objects feel free to use and array but if you need to store your elements in an unordered list, use the a hash.</p>

    <h3 id="classy-ruby">Classy Ruby</h3>

<p>Today we are going to take a look at creating a Ruby class. Ruby uses class statements which contain methods that work on the object. As your programs gets larger and more complicated Ruby needs classes so that you can have several of the same methods being performed on different objects. When you call the method later Ruby will know exactly which methods you are trying to perform because they have been defined by their class.&lt;</p>

<div class="links"><img src="/images/week_5/tech_1.png" alt="CSS Box Model" /><p>

In the image above you can see the beginnings of our very simple Person class we will use to store information about people. This class will need three things for input to be able to create the new person: first_name, last_name, and age. We need to use the initialize method here so we can call these variables later in our program. These are called instance variables and are denoted by using the @ symbol.
							

<div class="links"><img src="/images/week_5/tech_2.png" alt="CSS Box Model" /><p>

We can now use this class statement to create as many new Person's as we like. Let's go through "p1" and take at look at its format. First you give the new object a name (p1 or whatever you like it's up to you) and then call the Person.new class and provide the required information which in this case is their first name, last name , and age.
						
<div class="links"><img src="/images/week_5/tech_3.png" alt="CSS Box Model" /><p>

With the new persons created you can now use the Person class to do many cool things with the information you have stored. We've gone back and added a new method called "person_info" to the class. We can know take the information you have entered for each new person and have Ruby print out a nice little sentence using that information. In this case Ruby should tell us the person's first and last name and their age. 

							
<div class="links"><img src="/images/week_5/tech_4.png" alt="CSS Box Model" /><p>

As you can see from the above image, Ruby prints out a nice little sentence about each person. Man Bill Murray is getting up there in years but he's still awesome! This was just a very simple and basic example of what you can do with a Ruby class. You can add as many methods as you like to perform all sorts of creative functions on the objects. Go ahead and give it try!

    <h3 id="why-web-design-matters">Why Web Design Matters</h3>

<p>What constitutes web site nirvana is different for each user who browses the web. A bad choice of colors, images, or difficult navigation is enough to make users turn and run after just mere seconds of visiting a site. The design of your site itself is almost as important as the content since your homepage will makes the first impressions on the visiting users. But what kind of design makes a good web site?</p>

<p>One of my favorite web sites is <a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" title="twitter.com"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and what makes it stand out to me is its simplicity. The site, whether visited from a desktop or a mobile device, is clutter free with all the important application functions front and center making the readability and functions of the application simple for the user. Not sure if anyone could have predicted the success of twitter when it was in its infancy, but it has become a power house in the news industry. I use it almost exclusively to get live, real-time updates of current event and news. All of this information is literally at my fingertips. With a few simple clicks, I can search using the front-and-center search bar, create my own tweet, or discover new interesting account to follow in the future. It’s amazing that such a simple creation has single handedly revolutionized the news industry around the entire globe.</p>

<figcaption>Twitter Homepage</figcaption>
<p><img src="/images/twitter.png" alt="Twitter Homepage" /></p>

<p>Another of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank" title="Tumblr.com"><strong>Tumblr</strong></a>. Following the same model as twitter, Tumblr has created a simple, easy to use, and almost completely customizable web application for aspiring blogger’s. Everything the user needs is right at the tip of their finger. But Tumblr isn’t just a blogging site, its also a social site. Users can follow, comment, share, and discover millions of other blogs all stored in one simple web app. I specifically think the design of the tool bar at the top is elegant. Most everything the user needs is a one-touch click on the top of the page. The site also offers plenty of customization so users are able to create beautiful blog pages for their followers to read.</p>

<figcaption>Tumblr Homepage</figcaption>
<p><img src="/images/tumblr.png" alt="Tumblr Homepage" />						</p>

<p>My last example I’d like to discuss is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" title="Udemy.com"><strong>Udemy</strong></a>. While not as well known as Twitter and Tumbler, Udemy has created a beautiful web application which takes a very complex stream of instructional videos and packages them in a way that is easy for users to search and organize. Search is prominent and always easily accessible. Once again simplicity is the key factor in making this site exceptional. The user has the ability to store and organize an almost unlimited amount of video content with minimal and very easy to understand navigation buttons. Unlike Twitter and Tumblr, some of their content is not free but they do offer many useful free videos on all sorts of topics especially Ruby and Ruby on Rails!</p>
