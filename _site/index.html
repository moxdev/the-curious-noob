<p>This week we are being asked to discuss some values that we adhere to in our lives. Accomplishment is a big one. Although on a grand scale I haven’t achieved greatness in my accomplishments but I have worked really hard to get my life on track and I feel a sense of accomplishment for that even though I still have a long way to go. I came from a lower middle class family that had just enough money to provide me with life’s necessities but there was no emphasis put on higher education. I worked full time and payed my way through college to become the first college graduated of my family. After college I took a low paying networking internship in a small IT department and worked my way up to junior network administrator with three employees underneath my management. Now with no previous coding experience I’ve made it through Phase 0 of DBC about to start Phase 1 and I can’t wait to add this to my list of accomplishments. Bring it on!</p>

    <h3 id="the-trappings-of-stereotype-threat">The Trappings Of Stereotype Threat</h3>

<p>Being from a Caucasian middle class family I can’t say that I’ve experienced much stereotype threat personally in my life. I have however been surrounded by it for most of my life. I was born and raised in a small town in North Carolina. I witnessed for most of life the struggles of different ethnicities in a predominately white culture. Growing up I thought it was normal that whites lived on one side of town and most minorities lived on the opposite side. This was normal to me. This was just the way the world worked in my small ignorant view of the planet.</p>

<p>I grew up in a place where racial slurs are just as common as saying hello or goodbye. I’m reminded of a story of one of my first jobs. For this job we would have to go into peoples homes and install custom made blinds for their windows. I remember over hearing management discussing whether or not they should hire a new employee who was African American. He had like 10 years of experience so he was fully qualified but the owners were worried that white people would be scared to let him in their homes because of his race. Thankfully they made the decent decision to hire him despite their fears but that experience has always stuck with me. How terrible it must be to have that extra level of scrutiny added to a prospective job. I have never once thought to myself before an interview, “I wonder if my race will prevent me from getting this job?” I think this is something very hard for whites to wrap their head around since we don’t have to ever think about this. The sad thing is to someone born and raised in that environment, this is normal. This is just the way the world works.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until I got older and went to college that I realized this is not how the world works at all. When I left the south and moved to the D.C. metropolitan area, I quickly realized that I am the minority here. This city is truly a melting pot of world cultures and ethnicities. On one street here you can find restaurants with cuisine from just about any major country you can think of. Now I have a more personal stake in the Stereotype Threat theory. My wife is Pakistani and Muslim. She’s lived most of her life here in D.C. and says that she has experienced very little racism in her life. But I know from experience that whether or not she has noticed it she’s been judged for her ethnicity and religion many times over. Now with our first child on the way I think about how he will be effected by stereotype threat in a way that I never was. Will he have extra hurdles in life because of his mixed race? We’ve struggled in finding a name we can agree on because I am very conscious about having an American sounding name so his resume is not overlooked which I have personally seen happen. These are things I have never had to think about before in my life.</p>

<p>So though I have not personally been affected by stereotype type I have been surrounded by it my whole life. Living amongst so many different cultures and experiencing the friendship of people from all different ethnicities has opened my eyes to the struggles that minorities in America and allover the world experience on a daily basis.</p>

    <h3 id="web-design-wireframing">Web Design: Wireframing</h3>

<p>In this post I created a mock up of the Twitter, Tumblr, and Udemy websites so that we can briefly discuss how each site constructed some of their user interface elements.</p>

<p>Twitter has made extremely good use of the entire space of the web page. Twitter designers have managed to fit in all of the important options into the users feed page without being overly distracting or cumbersome.</p>

<ul>
  <li>search </li>
  <li>compose </li>
  <li>settings </li>
  <li>trending </li>
  <li>announcements</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/images/twitter_wireframe.png" alt="Twitter" /></p>

<p>Building on Twitters minimalist design, Tumblr has taken some of the same concepts and applied them to their social blogging site. Again all of the important functions are condensed and easily accessible without causing too much clutter and chaos. With just a few clicks the user can login, post their blog, and be on their way in mere minutes or even seconds!</p>

<p>For Udemy I chose the page a new visitor without an account would see when they first log onto the site. Udemy designers have managed to fit tons of content into a very minimalist homepage for new users.They keep it very neat and clean with a scrolling list of ‘featured’ courses, a search field, and a course list dropdown.From here the user simply types an interest into the search field or selects from the dropdown menu, and they are instantly redirected to video content related to that subject. The Internet truly has revolutionized the way human beings interact and learn!</p>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <h3 id="ruby-blocs-procs-and-lambdas-oh-my">Ruby Blocs, Procs, and Lambdas Oh My!</h3>

<p>Today we are going to take a look at one of Ruby’s most powerful features. Ruby uses what are called Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas to pass code to a method and then execute that code at a later point and time. Like most things in Ruby, these three functions perform very similar actions and can often be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Lets begin with discussing the Ruby Block. In the image above we have constructed a very simple .map! solution for iterating through an array and multiplying each number by 5. There are two ways to perform this action. First it can be written using the (do..end) syntax that you see in the first example. This syntax would often be used for a block containing multiple lines of code. In the second example you can see the (do..end) block has been replaced with just the curly brackets {}. This version would most often be used for a simple block of code that fits nicely on one line. The code in between the (do..end)and {} is what’s referred to as the block.</p>

<p><img src="/images/week_6/block.png" alt="block" /></p>

<p>Enter the Proc! So we can see here that using the Ruby Proc object of Proc.new, we can perform the same function as our block code. The Proc however is a little different from a block in that you are able to save the code and call it over and over again. You see the block code is simply syntax and as syntax it is disposable. In order to use the block again you must retype it whenever you need it. The Proc remedies this by allowing you to save the code inside of a variable which can then be called later. You must remember to use the &amp; symbol in front of your variable when passing your Proc as an argument like in the example above (&amp;multiply).</p>

<p><img src="/images/week_6/proc.png" alt="proc" /></p>

<p>So what’s the deal with Lambda? It may look like it is performing the exact same function as our previous Proc method but behind the scenes it is behaving very differently. First of all lambda will check to see if the correct number of arguments have been passed to it. If the wrong number of arguments are passed, lambda will issue an ArgumentError. Proc does not behave in the same manner. A Proc will ignore any unexpected arguments and assign nil as the value of any missing arguments. Another key difference is when a lambda returns, it will pass control back to the calling method. When a Proc returns, it returns immediately without going back to the calling method. This can cause different outcomes depending on how your code is written.</p>

<p><img src="/images/week_6/lambda.png" alt="lambda" /></p>

<p>So as you can see Blocks, Procs, and Lambdas are all very useful for performing certain functions in Ruby code. Go ahead and try it out on your own! I know I will be using them a lot more in my own coding in the future. </p>

<p>The Internet provides the world with a single point of access to seemingly unlimited resources of knowledge and entertainment.To most of us it is simply a matter of browsing to our preferred website, logging in with our username and password, and then going about our business. Most of us take for granted the code behind the scenes that makes all of this work.  </p>

<p>When you make a new user account for a website your information is stored in a database so it can be accessed later. This information is mostly likely stored in what is called an SQL database. These SQL databases can be used by hackers for nefarious purposes. SQL commands are simple text only inputs but in the wrongs hands they can be powerful tools used to steal user information, delete database information, or even cripple websites. Hackers can use “SQL Injection” to “inject” malicious SQL commands via webpage input. These malicious commands can compromise the security of a web application. A smart hacker can literally insert a new character or two and gain access to private information such as user logins. SQL injections can also be used to redirect users to malicious websites. If your web application becomes infected users may lose confidence in your ability to protect their data and stop using your services.</p>

<p>Check out this website <a href="http://sqlzoo.net/hack/" target="_blank">SQLZoo</a> for hands on demonstration of how hackers can use SQL injection to compromise your web application.</p>
