Is Dev Bootcamp the right fit for you? The question we've all no doubt been asking ourselves for the past few months. Watching Shereef's 'Fireside Chat' conjured feelings of sheer excitement, pure terror, a metaphorical rebirth, uncertainty, and a slew of other emotions all at once! For a year I've tied my gut up in knots over and over again trying to decide if DBC was worth quiting my cushy job, tearing my self away from my family, and uprooting myself to the other end of the country all for nothing more than the promise of a chance. There's something both simultaneously empowering and terrifying about having your fate in your on hands. It's right there in front of you all you have to do is reach out and take it.

I am Shereef's friend that he spoke about in the video. A junior system administrator that always wanted to be a coder but was told not to bother unless I get a 4 year Computer Science degree from a university. The moment I read the first article about DBC I knew there was something special happening in San Francisco that I needed to be a part of. The prospect of creating something special with code and being a part of something as special as DBC is no doubt going to be one of, if not the most fantastic experience of my life. I think learning by doing is the easiest way to learn a new skill. DBC's method of pairing us into groups and forcing all of us to take charge at certain points, instead of sitting at the back of class not saying anything, will only make us better, stronger coders when we get into the workforce. For me giving up is not an option because wearing a suit and tie to a cubicle for the next 30-40 years is not an option!

The wonderful life I'm leaving behind to become a coder...and yes this is every IT department you've ever called!
