### What Is Pair Programming?

![Ruby](/images/week_5/ruby_cat.jpg)

I'm going to admit it...I'm a loner. Well when it comes to completing tasks anyway. I would usually rather struggle through something on my own then admit that I don't know what I'm doing or asking for help out of a fear of looking stupid. As I'm writing this I'm thinking to myself, "Why am I like this? This sounds like a silly way to go about a task!" But alas, this is just the nature of some people I suppose. With that said let's discuss this new, and for some controversial, idea of pair programming.

So what exactly is pair programming? Pair programming is an "Agile Software Development" technique. The idea is basically to have two different coders writing code at the same machine. The pair consists of the "driver" and the "navigator," who write code on the same computer. The driver is in charge of typing the code while the navigator watches for any mistakes and thinks about different ways to implement the code as well as the overall structure of the code. Using this technique leaves the driver able to focus on the technical side of creating code while the navigator is free to think about the overall code of the project as well as check for any mistakes in the code made by the driver. Some studies have shown that using this technique can increase productivity and decrease errors in the code.

Those of us in Phase 0 should be getting used to using this technique by now. I have to admit the first few weeks my stomach was in knots before a paring session. It's a bad feeling when you are new to coding and your pair seems to know exactly where to go with the code while you are still trying to figure out exactly what the instructions for the project even mean! This week for the first time I've come to terms with the fact that I need to pair and I need to pair often. Even though I still get nervous and sometimes feel inferior when I'm working with a more experienced boot, I learn. This week really for the first time I've let my fears fall away and learned to enjoy the complexities of the challenges instead of fearing them. "What is this Greek I'm looking at in front of me?!" Take a deep breath, step back and figure it out. If you cant figure it out on your own it's ok to admit you need help. Your life will not crumble before your eyes if you do so. And most importantly pair and pair often!

So after the pair there's this "feedback" thing you also have to complete. At first I thought this was a nuisance. It still seems sort of tedious at times especially when it's 11:49 PM on Sunday night and you haven't submitted yet! This week though I am starting to see the value in this as well. I've gotten a few good critical feedback suggestions that have really helped me understand a big flaw in my coding process that I am now trying to remedy and it has helped me tremendously. Yesterday for the first time a boot asked me to do feedback right then an there in person. At first I thought this was strange and was a little caught off guard. After we finished the feedback I thought it was kind of nice to listen to the persons feedback instead of reading it later. The boot actually gave me one of the most beneficial pieces of constructive criticism yet and made me realize I need to work on that to become a better coder. So I guess the moral of this story is to trust the DBC process. It may seem a bit strange and even scary or chaotic at times, but there does seem to be a method to their madness. So I leave you with this bit of advice from a n00b with just a few months of coding experience under his belt. Pair. Pair often. Pair as much as you can and listen to your feedback and try to make changes that will help you once you get to the big show on Aug 25th at DBC. Trust the process!
