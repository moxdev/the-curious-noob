### Which Mindset Are You?

The Gregoric Thinking Style groups a person's "thinking style" into 4 general groups. Concrete, Abstract, Sequential, and Random. I think I would fit solidly into the Concrete Sequential. A person with Concrete Sequential thinking prefers order, stability, directions, not working in groups, a structured learning environment, etc. Pretty much the exact opposite of DBC! To a CS thinker Phase 0 of DBC seems like a Abstract Random free for all!

For a person like me DBC is going to be a challenge. I like structure. I like order. Not having instructions makes me panic. Phase 0 has been a whirl wind of emotions and pushing myself beyond my comfort zone. This is exactly why I chose DBC over the coding schools. I want to be pushed. If they let me I will sit in the back of the class never saying a word and working by myself. I want to learn to be the person who steps up to a challenge without being forced. I want to get over my fear of public speaking and be able to express my ideas to a large group of strangers without feeling like I'm going to throw up.

And as a double whammy I have a lot of the "Fixed Mindset" characteristics of the "Fixed vs Growth Mindset" theory. I tend to avoid challenges out of fear of failure and have a somewhat deterministic view of the world. I'm trying to become more of a Growth Mindset personality. I've stepped outside my comfort zone just about everyday since I've started Phase 0 and its getting easier day by day. I've found that my structured way of learning and completing my challenges doesn't cut it in DBC. Next week I'm starting a while new way of doing things to try and management my time better.I've realized in the world of coding you cant spend 4 hours trying to move an element around in CSS when you have several other tasks to complete. It doesn't matter if its perfect or not you just have to move on. This is very hard for me to accept. If I let myself I will spend all freaking day trying to move an element to the opposite side of my webpage. Time management and limiting my expectations to match my abilities are the two biggest things I will work on going forward in DBC. I'm willing to change are you?
