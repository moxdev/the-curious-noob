### The Invisible Cost Of The Gadgets We Love

Most of us today love our gadgets. They have become part of us in many ways. We've all had those moments of reaching in our pockets and realizing our phone is missing...then the panic sets in. These tiny pocket size computers are filled with some of our most precious information and tools we use to navigate through life on a daily basis. Most of us never realize the true cost of these machines as we unwrap the shiny packages and dance around on Christmas Day when we receive the latest greatest version of a device we desire. There is a human cost that is never factored into the price of tech industry's most coveted devices.
							
Now I feel I must give full disclosure as I am about to journey down the path of bashing a company of which I own several of their devices. I am an Apple fan and have been for many years. I own thousands of dollars worth of their equipment and have no intention to stop buying them in the near future. In the context of this article I am choosing to pick on apple not because they are the only or even the worst Tech industry human rights violators, but because they have become a symbol of wealth, power, and corporate dominance over mankind.

In some of Apple's Chinese factories workers are asked to stand for upwards of 12 hours a day with only two 30 minute breaks in between. Some of these factories are open six days a week. now Apple claims they have a self imposed 60 hour a week limit for workers, but some Chinese human rights organizations have reported 70 hour work weeks in different plants. China Labor Watch claims that most factory workers are subjected to harsh chemicals, noise, and lasers on a daily basis without adequate protection provided by the company. There have been several reports of workers dying from exposure to chemicals or even committing suicide because of the harsh working and living conditions near the plants.

Now in some aspects Apple should be commended for recently taking some steps to remedy the working conditions in their overseas factories. Apple is the first and only technology company to be admitted to the Fair Labor Association because of these steps they have taken. But their is much more work that needs to be done. Heavy regulations must be enforced by the cooperation of the U.S. and Chinese governments. Corporations usually exclaim that if we regulate these things the prices of their products will increase which in turn will hurt them and their consumers. This may be true in some aspects but the markup on some of these tech products is outrageous and I would argue there is a happy medium where a giant tech corporation worth upwards of $600 Billion dollars can afford to shave off some profits to protect the people who literally create those profits. It is important to understand that all tech companies not just Apple share in this burden. I hope that in the future as the IT industry grows, it can learn to balance profits with the welfare of its workers.
