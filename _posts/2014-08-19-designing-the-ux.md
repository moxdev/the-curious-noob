### Web Design: Wireframing

In this post I created a mock up of the Twitter, Tumblr, and Udemy websites so that we can briefly discuss how each site constructed some of their user interface elements.

Twitter has made extremely good use of the entire space of the web page. Twitter designers have managed to fit in all of the important options into the users feed page without being overly distracting or cumbersome.

- search 
- compose 
- settings 
- trending 
- announcements

Building on Twitters minimalist design, Tumblr has taken some of the same concepts and applied them to their social blogging site. Again all of the important functions are condensed and easily accessible without causing too much clutter and chaos. With just a few clicks the user can login, post their blog, and be on their way in mere minutes or even seconds!

For Udemy I chose the page a new visitor without an account would see when they first log onto the site. Udemy designers have managed to fit tons of content into a very minimalist homepage for new users.They keep it very neat and clean with a scrolling list of 'featured' courses, a search field, and a course list dropdown.From here the user simply types an interest into the search field or selects from the dropdown menu, and they are instantly redirected to video content related to that subject. The Internet truly has revolutionized the way human beings interact and learn!
