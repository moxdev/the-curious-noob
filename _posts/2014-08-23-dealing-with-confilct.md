### How do you deal with conflict?

Conflict is something we all have to deal with in life. There are some people in this world that have very strong personalities and when they get together with other strong personalities often times they will clash. In my previous job as a Junior Network Administrator, I was often in the position of telling people things they did not want to hear. This would often result in arguments. I have to admit I am a pretty easy going guy and rarely will I engage in arguments with coworkers. On one particular occasion I was working on an accountant's computer. I told the accountant that it would probably be about 20 minutes until I was finished and I would then return the computer to him. While working on his system I quickly realized there was something really wrong with his machine and it would take much longer then expected to fix. After about 25 minutes he returned expecting to find his computer working but instead found me feverishly trying to fix it. When I told him there was an issue and I wasn't sure how long it was going to take to fix it. He flew into a rage and started screaming about how he had deadlines to meet and I said it would only take 20 minutes to fix. If you've ever seen an accountant with a deadline it's not a pretty site. Needless to say that we got into a huge argument in the middle of the office that ended with me walking away and leaving him without a working computer for awhile. Although I believe he was in the wrong for starting the argument I wish I had stayed calmer and tried to calm him down instead of making the situation worse by yelling back at him. We ended up being great friends later and I soon came to realize he was just under a lot of stress due to constant deadlines he had to meet. I learned two things that day. First I should stay calm and not be pushed into an argument by someone else's actions. Second, never give a user a set time frame for working on their machine because computers are unpredictable.

I leave you with a link to an email from Linus Torvold, the creator of the Linux operating system and an infamous world class a-hole computer programmer.
