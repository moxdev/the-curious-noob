### "I'm good enough, I'm smart enough, and doggone it people like me." - Stuart Smalley

This week we are being asked to discuss some values that we adhere to in our lives. Accomplishment is a big one. Although on a grand scale I haven't achieved greatness in my accomplishments but I have worked really hard to get my life on track and I feel a sense of accomplishment for that even though I still have a long way to go. I came from a lower middle class family that had just enough money to provide me with life's necessities but there was no emphasis put on higher education. I worked full time and payed my way through college to become the first college graduated of my family. After college I took a low paying networking internship in a small IT department and worked my way up to junior network administrator with three employees underneath my management. Now with no previous coding experience I've made it through Phase 0 of DBC about to start Phase 1 and I can't wait to add this to my list of accomplishments. Bring it on!
