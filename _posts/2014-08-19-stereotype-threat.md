### The Trappings Of Stereotype Threat

Being from a Caucasian middle class family I can't say that I've experienced much stereotype threat personally in my life. I have however been surrounded by it for most of my life. I was born and raised in a small town in North Carolina. I witnessed for most of life the struggles of different ethnicities in a predominately white culture. Growing up I thought it was normal that whites lived on one side of town and most minorities lived on the opposite side. This was normal to me. This was just the way the world worked in my small ignorant view of the planet.
							
I grew up in a place where racial slurs are just as common as saying hello or goodbye. I'm reminded of a story of one of my first jobs. For this job we would have to go into peoples homes and install custom made blinds for their windows. I remember over hearing management discussing whether or not they should hire a new employee who was African American. He had over 10 years of experience so he was fully qualified but the owners were worried that white people would be scared to let him in their homes because of his race. Thankfully they made the decent decision to hire him despite their fears but that experience has always stuck with me. How terrible it must be to have that extra level of scrutiny added to a prospective job. I have never once thought to myself before an interview, "I wonder if my race will prevent me from getting this job?" I think this is something very hard for whites to wrap their head around since we don't have to ever think about this. The sad thing is to someone born and raised in that environment, this is normal. This is just the way the world works.
							
It wasn't until I got older and went to college that I realized this is not how the world works at all. When I left the south and moved to the D.C. metropolitan area, I quickly realized that I am the minority here. This city is truly a melting pot of world cultures and ethnicities. On one street here you can find restaurants with cuisine from just about any major country you can think of. Now I have a more personal stake in the Stereotype Threat theory. My wife is Pakistani and Muslim. She's lived most of her life here in D.C. and says that she has experienced very little racism in her life. But I know from experience that whether or not she has noticed it she's been judged for her ethnicity and religion many times over. Now with our first child on the way I think about how he will be effected by stereotype threat in a way that I never was. Will he have extra hurdles in life because of his mixed race? We've struggled in finding a name we can agree on because I am very conscious about having an American sounding name so his resume is not overlooked which I have personally seen happen. These are things I have never had to think about before in my life.
						
So though I have not personally been affected by stereotype type I have been surrounded by it my whole life. Living amongst so many different cultures and experiencing the friendship of people from all different ethnicities has opened my eyes to the struggles that minorities in America and allover the world experience on a daily basis.
