### Why Web Design Matters


What constitutes web site nirvana is different for each user who browses the web. A bad choice of colors, images, or difficult navigation is enough to make users turn and run after just mere seconds of visiting a site. The design of your site itself is almost as important as the content since your homepage will makes the first impressions on the visiting users. But what kind of design makes a good web site?

One of my favorite web sites is <a href="https://www.twitter.com" target="_blank" title="twitter.com"><strong>Twitter</strong></a> and what makes it stand out to me is its simplicity. The site, whether visited from a desktop or a mobile device, is clutter free with all the important application functions front and center making the readability and functions of the application simple for the user. Not sure if anyone could have predicted the success of twitter when it was in its infancy, but it has become a power house in the news industry. I use it almost exclusively to get live, real-time updates of current event and news. All of this information is literally at my fingertips. With a few simple clicks, I can search using the front-and-center search bar, create my own tweet, or discover new interesting account to follow in the future. It's amazing that such a simple creation has single handedly revolutionized the news industry around the entire globe.

Another of my favorite websites is <a href="https://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank" title="Tumblr.com"><strong>Tumblr</strong></a>. Following the same model as twitter, Tumblr has created a simple, easy to use, and almost completely customizable web application for aspiring blogger's. Everything the user needs is right at the tip of their finger. But Tumblr isn't just a blogging site, its also a social site. Users can follow, comment, share, and discover millions of other blogs all stored in one simple web app. I specifically think the design of the tool bar at the top is elegant. Most everything the user needs is a one-touch click on the top of the page. The site also offers plenty of customization so users are able to create beautiful blog pages for their followers to read.

My last example I'd like to discuss is <a href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank" title="Udemy.com"><strong>Udemy</strong></a>. While not as well known as Twitter and Tumbler, Udemy has created a beautiful web application which takes a very complex stream of instructional videos and packages them in a way that is easy for users to search and organize. Search is prominent and always easily accessible. Once again simplicity is the key factor in making this site exceptional. The user has the ability to store and organize an almost unlimited amount of video content with minimal and very easy to understand navigation buttons. Unlike Twitter and Tumblr, some of their content is not free but they do offer many useful free videos on all sorts of topics especially Ruby and Ruby on Rails!
