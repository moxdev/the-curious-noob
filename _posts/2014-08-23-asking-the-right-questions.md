### How do you ask a question?

That might sound like an absurd statement but sometimes it really does matter how you ask a question. The way you ask a question could determine if you get the correct answer or not. First you need to make sure you have a clear and concise understanding of what you are asking for. To do this follow my suggestions below.

First off you should start out by searching Google to first see if you can figure out the answer for yourself. This will often not only answer your questions but educate you on other aspects you haven't though of yet by visiting multiple sites that Google suggests on your search. Several times I have learned about something that I have never heard about just because I was searching for something else. So make sure to utilize Google as much as possible.

If you cant quite figure out the answer on your own, then you may need to ask a question online. This can be very helpful especially when dealing with complicated coding questions. There are many online communities dedicated to helping coders find solutions to their problems. [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) for example is a community for coders to ask and answer coding questions. Simply create a free account and you can post your questions and wait for other users to help you with your code. 

When asking a question in an online forum such as stackoverflow, make sure you include all the information necessary to answer your question or you may not get the answer you need. It may even be a good idea to post your code so the other users can see exactly what you are doing and even copy the code and run it themselves for testing.

Those of us new to coding may feel a little anxiety about asking questions. I know I sometimes wonder if I'm asking a stupid question or not. To an experienced coder your question may seem as simple as 1,2,3 but as a newcomer to coding you need to fight through your fears and ask as many questions as you need to get the answers you require. This is essential to your growth and learning as a coder. So just make sure you have done a little research beforehand and then ask away until someone gets you the answers you need.
