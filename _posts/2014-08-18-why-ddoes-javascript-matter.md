### Java What?

In today's world of complicated user interactive websites, it is important for web developers to know and understand JavaScript. You might not realize it but most, if not all, of your favorite websites incorporate JavaScript into their web development to create "dynamic" web pages. Below are some advantages and disadvantages of using JavaScript in Web Development.

One of the advantages of JavaScript is that it runs on the users computer and uses the computers processor. Entire web based applications can be run right from the browser. It makes it much easier since there is nothing on the server side to configure. This leaves the busy server free to handle other jobs. JS is also be used for data entry validation to check things like valid credit card numbers. It can manipulate cookies to store user information on the browser. These are just some of the many advantages of using JavaScript.

But JavaScript is not without its disadvantages either. The biggest issue with JS is security. Since JS runs on the client side it can be used to inject malicious code into the users computer spreading malware and viruses. Another problem is that different browsers render JavaSrcipt differently resulting in inconsistencies across browsers. Overall the advantages of making dynamic JavaScript websites seem to outweigh the disadvantages.
